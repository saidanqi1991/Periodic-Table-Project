# Periodic-Table-Project
Freecodecamp_Periodic Table
This is a freecodecamp project. See instruction below: 

Instructions
You are started with a periodic_table database that has information about some chemical elements. You can connect to it by entering psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=periodic_table in the terminal. You may want to get a little familiar with the existing tables, columns, and rows. Read the instructions below and complete user stories to finish the project. Certain tests may not pass until other user stories are complete. Good luck!

Part 1: Fix the database

There are some mistakes in the database that need to be fixed or changed. See the user stories below for what to change.

Part 2: Create your git repository

You need to make a small bash program. The code needs to be version controlled with git, so you will need to turn the suggested folder into a git repository.

Part 3: Create the script
Lastly, you need to make a script that accepts an argument in the form of an atomic number, symbol, or name of an element and outputs some information about the given element. In your script, you can create a PSQL variable for querying the database like this: PSQL="psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=<database_name> -t --no-align -c", add more flags if you need to.
